                <p class="about-text">Hello, my name is Willy Indrayana Komara, most people call me Will or Willy.
                    <br>I'm originally from Sumedang (West Java), but currently staying in Surakarta (Central Java) for more than 2 years. 
                    <br>Currently, I'm still pursuing a degree in Informatics Engineering at Sebelas Maret University.
                </p>
                
                <p class="about-text">
                    For the past 2 years, besides doing typical college student activities, I've been active in participating in a lot of programming competitions at national or international levels. 
                    From those experiences, I learned a lot about how to design the best algorithm for certain problems, how to think fast, how to solve a problem with specific constraints, and how to work with a team. 
                    <br>
                </p>
                
                <p class="about-text">
                    I also have done some collaboration projects in game development with some other students from different fields, such as Biology Educational Game and other casual games. 
                    I mainly used Unity and C# to develope those games, but there was a time I used C++ with SFML library in game development.
                </p>
                
                <p class="about-text">
                    Recently, I'm very hooked with web development, especially using technologies such as ReactJS and Golang. 
                    <br>In fact, currently I'm developing my own project in my spare time using these tools, and I'm having fun with it. 
                    <br>I never actually thought that I would be this excited after falling into Javascript and Golang (if only I could have been falling for these "guys" a long time ago). 
                </p>
                
                <p class="about-text">
                    One of the web development projects I'm currently working on is KomisiART (<a href="https://komisi.art">https://komisi.art</a>), it is mainly developed using ReactJS and Golang. 
                    I'm taking the role as front-end programmer as well as back-end programmer.  I used RESTful API architecture in that project, although I'm still working on it.  I also had integrated Firebase (auth and storage) into the project. 
                    Besides KomisiART, I have done several  other web development projects using plain PHP, CodeIgniter, and Laravel, and Java Servlet/JSP.
                </p>
                
                <p class="about-text">
                    I'm pretty much exposed to English every single day, so I'm very comfortable using English for communication purposes. 
                    But of course, Indonesian is my main language, while Sundanese is my mother tongue language. 
                    I know a little bit Japanese as well, but still working on it. 
                    So we can always talk with any of these languages, I will try my best!
